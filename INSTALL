INSTALLATION
============

This distribution may be installed via one of the following methods:

1   Using Module::Build (distributed with Perl since perl-5.9.4):

    perl Build.PL
    perl Build
    perl Build test
    perl Build install

    This is cross platform as long as you have a recent enough perl.

2   Using ExtUtils::MakeMaker (distributed with Perl since perl-5):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

    If you are on a Windows machine you should use 'nmake' or 'dmake'
    rather than 'make'. Or, so I'm told

If you are unsure, go with the first option.
